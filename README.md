## Scaled Area

This prefab defines an area where users will automatically be scaled to a specific height, and going out of the area will restore the height back to what it was. For example, you can have people be automatically scaled to be tiny while in the area.

Scaled Area is also available on the [VketStore](https://store.vket.com/en/items/9293)
